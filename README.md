# SQL-Covid-19-Portfolio-Project
The Covid-19 data, which was divided into two datasets—Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations—was used in this project, which centers on using SQL for exploratory data analysis and querying. Covid data from February 2020 to May 2022 are included.
The purpose of this analysis is to learn more about and gain understanding of the global impact of COVID-19.
